            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This project was made for during the Production Process and Pipeline module for University at the end of my first year, where we had to work in a group to produce a fully functioning game. My team was a group of three and were given 9 weeks to produce a game given the conditions of a real team environment. This module ran alongside a solo project where we had to make the mechanics of a game, shown in "Turn-based RPG"</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p> We began by learning what everyone's strengths and weaknesses were, and how best we can channel people's abilities into the areas they work best in. We then went on to create a general concept for the game, where we landed on making a game where the player is a cheif who has to shoot ingredients a burger to complete the order.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p> As the team was small, everyone in the team would have to cross different specialisms. However, we took on a main role each, to minimise the amount of confusion on who was working on what. I mainly took on implementing Gameplay as I programmed: the player, the weapons, the system tracking the order on the burger, the system getting and completing the order and the upgrade system. Due to time constrants and the deadline getting closer, I also had to implement the HUD UI and added the "How to Play" section into the main menu.</p>
